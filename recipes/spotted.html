<h2>Spotted dick is a British steamed pudding made with dried fruit and served with custard sauce--of course.</h2>

<p>Non-traditional variants include recipes that replace suet with other fats (such as butter), or that include eggs to make something similar to a sponge pudding or cake</p>

<p>"Spotted" is a reference to the dried fruit in the pudding (which resemble spots). "Dick" and "dog" were dialectal terms widely used for pudding, from the same etymology as "dough" (i.e., the modern equivalent name would be "spotted pudding").</p>

<h3>Ingredients</h3>

<ul>
    <li>½ cup whole milk</li>
    <li>½ cup heavy whipping cream</li>
    <li>⅛ teaspoon kosher salt</li>
    <li>¼ cup granulated sugar</li>
    <li>2 large egg yolks</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
</ul>

<h3>Steps</h3>

<ol>
    <li>Heat milk, cream, and salt in a saucepan over medium-low heat, stirring often until steaming.</li>
    <li>Whisk together sugar and egg yolks in a bowl until well combined. Gradually pour half of warm milk mixture into egg yolk mixture, whisking constantly.</li>
    <li>Remove from heat and whisk in vanilla extract. Strain egg yolk mixture through a fine mesh sieve into a bowl; let cool, uncovered, at room temperature for 30 minutes. </li>
    <li>While custard sauce cools, grease a 1.5-quart heat proof metal bowl with butter.</li>
    <li>Whisk together flour, baking powder, and salt in a large bowl. Cut butter into flour mixture by hand or using a pastry blender until mixture resembles coarse breadcrumbs.</li>
</ol>
